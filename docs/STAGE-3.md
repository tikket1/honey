# Stage 3 — bytecode and the loader

Stage 3 is where honey stops being a pure-Mac exercise and starts running
inside a real Linux kernel. It has two halves:

- **Mac side (Rust):** turn the AST into eBPF bytecode. Modules `bpf.rs`
  (the instruction encoder + disassembler) and `codegen.rs` (AST → program),
  with `layout.rs` computing event record layouts. Fully testable on macOS.
- **Linux side (C):** `linux/loader.c` loads the bytecode into the kernel,
  attaches it to a tracepoint, and prints the events. Needs a Linux kernel.

## The Linux environment

You don't need a full VM. Docker Desktop already runs a Linux kernel (6.12,
with BPF + BTF), and a privileged container on it can load BPF programs. The
helper wraps that:

```bash
linux/honey-linux                      # interactive shell in the environment
linux/honey-linux make -C linux        # build the loader
```

The image carries only userspace tooling (clang, gcc, libbpf); the kernel is
Docker's own. First run builds the image.

## The end-to-end loop

```bash
# 1. Compile a probe to bytecode + a manifest (on macOS):
cargo run -- build examples/exec.hny -o build/exec
#    -> build/exec.bin  (raw eBPF instructions)
#    -> build/exec.json (tracepoint, ring-buffer size, event layout)

# 2. Load and run it (in the Linux environment):
linux/honey-linux ./linux/run.sh build/exec.bin build/exec.json
#    prints: pid=... uid=... comm=... for every execve, system-wide
```

Inspect the bytecode without a kernel:

```bash
cargo run -- --asm examples/exec.hny   # disassemble what codegen produced
```

## What the loader does (the kernel ABI, step by step)

1. **Create the ring-buffer map** (`bpf_map_create`). This is the channel the
   program uses to push event records to userspace.
2. **Relocate the map reference.** honeyc emits `ld64 r1, map_fd(0)` — a
   placeholder. The loader rewrites that immediate to the real map fd. This is
   the one link between the statically-compiled program and the runtime map.
3. **Load the program** (`bpf_prog_load`). The kernel verifier runs here. If
   honey emitted anything unsafe, this is where it is rejected — which is
   exactly the failure mode stage 4's type system exists to prevent.
4. **Attach to the tracepoint.** Read the tracepoint's numeric id from
   tracefs, `perf_event_open` it, and `ioctl(PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF)`. That
   binds the program to the tracepoint for the whole system.
5. **Poll the ring buffer** and decode each record using the field offsets in
   the manifest.

## What codegen supports today (and what's next)

This first slice compiles exactly one shape: a single `tracepoint` probe whose
body is one `emit` of an event, where each field is a nullary builtin
(`pid()`, `uid()`, `ktime()`, ...) or `comm()`. That is `examples/exec.hny`,
and it exercises the entire pipeline end to end.

Deliberately not yet supported (codegen returns a clear error rather than
emitting something the verifier would reject): `const`, `map`, `if`/`for`,
arithmetic, and string matching. Those are stage 3b, and they build on the
same reserve/fill/submit skeleton. `examples/exec_burst.hny` and
`examples/sensitive_open.hny` parse but do not yet compile.

## The verifier is your test oracle

The kernel refuses to load a program it can't prove safe, and its rejection
message is the ground truth for whether codegen is correct. When you extend
codegen, the loop is: emit, load, read the verifier's complaint, fix. Stage 4
moves those complaints to compile time.
